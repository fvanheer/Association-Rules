# Association-Rules
 Association rule mining, at a basic level, involves the use of machine learning models to analyze data for patterns, or co-occurrence, in a database. It identifies frequent if-then associations, which are called association rules.

## Built With

* [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) - More info

### Libraries to install 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or pip install 
```
pandas
numpy
streamlit
altair
pydec
```

### Data

* [Find the Data here]() - Download the publik dataset from here

## The Model

You can find the code in the model model.py file 

### Deployment options

* Docker Setup. 
* Include the computations as a part of your ETL process (I use [KNIME](https://www.knime.com/)) - Include it as a step before writing the final customer lifetime table to your Data Warehouse.
